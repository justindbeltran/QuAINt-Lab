abstract = {Network verification, broadly defined as proving the correctness of certain properties resulting from a network's configuration, cannot be efficiently solved on classical hardware via brute force. Prior work has developed a variety of methods that scale by observing a structure in the search space and then evaluating classes induced by that structure. However, even these classification mechanisms have their limitations. In this paper, we consider a radically different approach: applying quantum computing to more efficiently solve network verification problems. We provide an overview of how to map variants of verification problems into unstructured search problems that can be solved via quantum computing with quadratic speedup, making the approach feasible in theory to problems that twice as big in the size of the input. Emerging quantum systems cannot yet tackle problems of practical interest, but rapid advances in hardware and algorithm development make now a great time to start thinking about their application. With this in mind, we explore the limits of scale of the problem for which quantum computing can solve network verification problems as unstructured search.},
